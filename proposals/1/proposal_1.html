<h2>2 Dataset:</h2>
<pre><code>        The dataset is going to be from the Saudi Arabian Statistical Authority, encompassing diverse statistical data ranging from demographics, economics, education, and healthcare. This comprehensive dataset will be invaluable for multifaceted analysis and research.
</code></pre>
<h2>3 Rationale:</h2>
<pre><code>        This project is going to help bridge the gap between raw data availability and practical usability. By cleaning and organizing the data, we make it more accessible and useful for researchers, policy-makers, and businesses, thereby fostering data-driven decision-making and innovation.
</code></pre>
<h2>4 Approach:</h2>
<pre><code>        I plan on approaching this capstone through several steps:

        1. Data Collection: Accessing and downloading relevant datasets from the Saudi Arabian Statistical Authority.
        2. Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting inaccuracies, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
        3. Data Analysis: Conducting preliminary analysis to understand data trends and characteristics.
        4. Data Packaging: Organizing the cleaned data into a user-friendly format, with comprehensive documentation.
        5. Validation: Ensuring data integrity and accuracy post-cleaning.
        6. Final Review: A thorough review of the dataset and accompanying documentation.
